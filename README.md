### Hi, my name is Dana! 

I'm currently a senior at Rutgers studying linguistic theory as well as computer science. I typically enjoy working with Jupyter, R, SQL, Pandas, and PyTorch for my projects. 

### What am I all about? 
I'm highly interested in exploring statistics and machine learning research, and I hope to study and work in both disciplines.
On the side, I have a music project called "Libero". In my music, I typically include elements created in livecoding tools like TidalCycles and Max\MSP. Talk to me about digital signal processing! 

Thanks for reading!
